CynoMap
=======

A simple library to take a EVE API Corp Members output and work out the jump range between them, so for example, a cyno corp, you can work out all the jump routes available within the corporation.

This is extremely experimental is nowhere complete. The maps are generated out in SVG format and a simple Flask container is included to allow maps to be generated as required for a specific lightyear distance.

Requirements
------------

* Entity's EVE API module (pip install eveapi)
* Latest SDE extract from CCP
